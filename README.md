# 🎮 PokeWho: My First AI Agent

> This project represents my first steps into building AI agents and is part of my personal learning journey!

## 📝 Project Overview

PokeWho is an intelligent conversational agent specialized in Pokémon knowledge. Built using LangChain and LangGraph, this AI assistant can retrieve and present detailed information about any Pokémon in an engaging, well-structured format.

## ✨ Features

- 🔎 **Intelligent Pokémon Information Retrieval**: Automatically identifies Pokémon names in user queries and retrieves relevant information
- 📚 **Comprehensive Data**: Provides details on types, abilities, stats, habitat, evolution, and generation
- 🌟 **Engaging Responses**: Formats answers in a friendly, enthusiastic tone with emojis and fun facts
- 🔄 **Tool-Augmented Workflow**: Uses LangGraph to create a flexible agent capable of using tools to enhance responses

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: Framework for building language model applications
- **LangGraph**: For creating the agent's workflow and tool usage logic
- **Qwen 2.5**: The language model powering the agent's intelligence
- **Python**: Primary programming language

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Create a `.env` file with necessary API keys
4. Run the agent with:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 🌱 Learning Journey

This project represents my first exploration into building AI agents. Through this project, I've learned:

- How to construct an AI agent using modern frameworks
- Techniques for retrieving and structuring domain-specific knowledge
- Implementing tool-using capabilities in language models
- Creating conversational flows with LangGraph

As I continue to learn and grow in the field of AI, I plan to enhance this project with more features and capabilities.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add image recognition capabilities
- Implement multi-turn conversation memory
- Expand the knowledge base to include more detailed Pokémon information
- Add battle strategy recommendations
- Create a web interface for easier interaction
